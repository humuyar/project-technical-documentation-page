                What is C++?
            </header>
            <p>
                C++ is a general purpose programming
                language and widely used now a days '
                for competitive programming. It has
                imperative, object-oriented and generic
                programming features. C++ runs on lots of
                platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                C++ is an efficient
                and powerful language and finds wide use
                in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
                real-time simulations. Because of the
                inclusion of rich function libraries,
                working in C++ becomes simpler and
                convenient than C. Being object-oriented
                programming like Java, C++ provides
                the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
                encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
                exception handling and function overloading.

            <p>he “Hello World” program is the first
                step towards learning any programming
                language and also one of the simplest
                programs you will learn. All you have
                to do is display the message “Hello World”
                on the screen.
                <br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>
            </p>
            <code>
                #include<iostream>  
                <br>
                using namespace std;  
                <br>
                int main() 
                <br>
                    { 
                        <br>
                        cout〈〈"Hello World"; 
                        <br>
                        return 0; 
                        <br>
                    } 
            </code>

            <p>C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
                <br> The main pillars of Object Oriented
                Programming are :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Objects and Classes</li>
                <li>Inheritance</li>
                <li>Polymorphism</li>
                <li>Abstraction</li>
                <li>Encapsulation</li>

                Objects and Classes
            </header>
            <p>
                Object-oriented programming – As the name
                suggests uses objects in programming.
                Object-oriented programming aims to
                implement real-world entities like
                inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
                etc in programming. The main
                aim of OOP is to bind together the data
                and the functions that operate on them
                so that no other part of the code can
                access this data except that function.
            </p>
            <p><b>Object : </b>An Object is an identifiable
                entity with some characteristics and behavior.
                An Object is an instance of a Class. When a
                class is defined, no memory is allocated but
                when it is instantiated (i.e. an
                object is created) memory is allocated.
                <br>
                <b>Class : </b>The building block of C++ that
                leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
                It is a user-defined data type, which holds its
                own data members and member functions, which can
                be accessed & used by creating an instance
                of that class. A class is like a blueprint for
                an object. For Example: Consider the Class
                of Cars. There may be many cars with different
                names and brand but all of them will share
                some common properties like all of them will
                have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.
                So here, Car is the class and wheels,
                speed limits, mileage are their properties.
