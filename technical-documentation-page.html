                What is C++?
            </header>
            <p>
                C++ is a general purpose programming
                language and widely used now a days '
                for competitive programming. It has
                imperative, object-oriented and generic
                programming features. C++ runs on lots of
                platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                C++ is an efficient
                and powerful language and finds wide use
                in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
                real-time simulations. Because of the
                inclusion of rich function libraries,
                working in C++ becomes simpler and
                convenient than C. Being object-oriented
                programming like Java, C++ provides
                the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
                encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
                exception handling and function overloading.

            <p>he “Hello World” program is the first
                step towards learning any programming
                language and also one of the simplest
                programs you will learn. All you have
                to do is display the message “Hello World”
                on the screen.
