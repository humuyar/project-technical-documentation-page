                What is C++?
            </header>
            <p>
                C++ is a general purpose programming
                language and widely used now a days '
                for competitive programming. It has
                imperative, object-oriented and generic
                programming features. C++ runs on lots of
                platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                C++ is an efficient
                and powerful language and finds wide use
                in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
                real-time simulations. Because of the
                inclusion of rich function libraries,
                working in C++ becomes simpler and
                convenient than C. Being object-oriented
                programming like Java, C++ provides
                the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
                encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
                exception handling and function overloading.

            <p>he “Hello World” program is the first
                step towards learning any programming
                language and also one of the simplest
                programs you will learn. All you have
                to do is display the message “Hello World”
                on the screen.
                <br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>
            </p>
            <code>
                #include<iostream>  
                <br>
                using namespace std;  
                <br>
                int main() 
                <br>
                    { 
                        <br>
                        cout〈〈"Hello World"; 
                        <br>
                        return 0; 
                        <br>
                    } 
            </code>

            <p>C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
                <br> The main pillars of Object Oriented
                Programming are :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Objects and Classes</li>
                <li>Inheritance</li>
                <li>Polymorphism</li>
                <li>Abstraction</li>
                <li>Encapsulation</li>

                Objects and Classes
            </header>
            <p>
                Object-oriented programming – As the name
                suggests uses objects in programming.
                Object-oriented programming aims to
                implement real-world entities like
                inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
                etc in programming. The main
                aim of OOP is to bind together the data
                and the functions that operate on them
                so that no other part of the code can
                access this data except that function.
            </p>
            <p><b>Object : </b>An Object is an identifiable
                entity with some characteristics and behavior.
                An Object is an instance of a Class. When a
                class is defined, no memory is allocated but
                when it is instantiated (i.e. an
                object is created) memory is allocated.
                <br>
                <b>Class : </b>The building block of C++ that
                leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
                It is a user-defined data type, which holds its
                own data members and member functions, which can
                be accessed & used by creating an instance
                of that class. A class is like a blueprint for
                an object. For Example: Consider the Class
                of Cars. There may be many cars with different
                names and brand but all of them will share
                some common properties like all of them will
                have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.
                So here, Car is the class and wheels,
                speed limits, mileage are their properties.

                Inheritance
            </header>
            <p>
                The capability of a class to derive
                properties and characteristics from
                another class is called Inheritance.
                Inheritance is one of the most important
                feature of Object Oriented Programming.
                Sub Class: The class that inherits
                properties from another class
                is called Sub class or Derived Class.
                Super Class: The class whose properties
                are inherited by sub class is called Base
                Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we
                have to write the functions only one time
                instead of three times as we
                have inherited rest of the three classes
                from base class(Vehicle).
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>Mode of Inheritance : </b><br><br>

                <b>Public Mode : </b>If we derive a sub
                class from a public base class. Then the
                public member of the base class will
                become public in the derived class and
                protected members of the base class
                will become protected in derived class.
                <br><br>
                <b>Protected Mode : </b>If we derive a
                sub class from a Protected base class.
                Then both public member and protected
                members of the base class will become
                protected in derived class.
                <br><br>
                <b>Private Mode : </b>If we derive a
                sub class from a Private base class.
                Then both public member and protected
                members of the base class will become
                Private in derived class.
                <br><br>
                <b>Types of Inheritance in C++ : </b>
                <br><br><br>
                <b>Single Inheritance :</b> In single
                inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit
                from only one class. i.e. one sub class
                is inherited by one base class only.
                <br><br>
                <b>Multiple Inheritance :</b> Multiple
                Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a
                class can inherit from more than one
                classes. i.e one sub class is inherited
                from more than one base classes.
                <br><br>
                <b>Multilevel Inheritance :</b> In this
                type of inheritance, a derived class is
                created from another derived class.
                <br><br>
                <b>Hieratical Inheritance :</b> In this
                type of inheritance, more than one sub
                class is inherited from a single base
                class i.e. more than one derived class
                is created from a single base class.
                <br><br>
                <b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance :</b>
                Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by
                combining more than one type of
                inheritance.
                For example: Combining Hierarchical
                inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.
